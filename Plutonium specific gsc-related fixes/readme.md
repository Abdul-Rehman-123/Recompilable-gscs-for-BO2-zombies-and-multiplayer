# Fixed gscs for Plutonium Only:

### Audio Announcer Fix

Compile _zm_audio_announcer.gsc and place it in maps/mp/zombies.

This will fix the announcer not having any dialog on all maps and gamemodes.

### Tombstone Fix

Compile zm_transit_utility.gsc and place it in maps/mp.

This will allow tombstone to spawn in on dedicated servers.

### 8 Player Origins Fix

Compile zm_tomb_amb.gsc as zm_tomb_amb.gsc and place it maps/mp

Compile zm_tomb_craftables.gsc as zm_tomb_craftables.gsc and place it maps/mp

Compile zm_tomb_dig.gsc as zm_tomb_dig.gsc and place it maps/mp

This fixes the crashes caused by 8 players on origins

# Fixed gscs for Plutonium Only:

### Zombies Announcer

Compile _zm_audio_announcer.gsc and place it in maps/mp/zombies.

This will fix the announcer not having any dialog on all maps and gamemodes.

### Tombstone

Compile zm_transit_utility.gsc and place it in maps/mp.

This will allow tombstone to spawn in on dedicated servers.

### Bots

Compile _bot.gsc and place it maps/mp/bots

This should fix the bots difficulty on dedicated servers.
